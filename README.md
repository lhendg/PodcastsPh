What are the Top Podcasts in the Philippines?

## This project's goal is to answer the following questions. 
1. What are the top podcasts in the Philippines?
2. Why do you think they're popular?
3. What categories are most popular? 
4. If you were going to start a podcast today, what would you start and why?

## Acquiring the dataset
First, I collected all the links under the Popular Podcasts in iTunes separated by genres. Once I got all the links, I built the dataframe using the iTunes API. Since I cannot find a reliable Podcasts Chart for the Philippines, I encoded the Chart from spotify that can be found <a href='https://open.spotify.com/genre/podcast-charts-body' targe=blank>here</a>.
