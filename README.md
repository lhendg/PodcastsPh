What are the Top Podcasts in the Philippines?

## This project's goal is to answer the following questions. 
1. What are the top podcasts in the Philippines?
2. Why do you think they're popular?
3. What categories are most popular? 
4. If you were going to start a podcast today, what would you start and why?

## Acquiring the dataset
First, I collected all the links under the Popular Podcasts in iTunes separated by genres. Once I got all the links, I built the dataframe using the iTunes API. Since I cannot find a reliable Podcasts Chart for the Philippines, I encoded the Chart from spotify that can be found <a href='https://open.spotify.com/genre/podcast-charts-body' target='_blank'>here</a>. Then from there, I acquired the iTunes ID from the initial dataset, so I can scrape the rest of the data that I need to build the Spotify Charts dataset that can be seen on the index. Aside from that, all of the datasets can be found on the data folder.
