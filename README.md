# PodcastsPh
What are the Top Podcasts in the Philippines?

## This project goal is to answer the following questions. 
1. What are the top podcasts in the Philippines?
2. Why do you think they're popular?
3. What categories are most popular? 
4. If you were going to start a podcast today, what would you start and why?

### Creating the database
I manually encoded the title and the iTunes ID of each podcast. Then, I created the dataframe using the iTunes API. 

### Limitations
This project only includes those podcasts who are included in the Spotify Podcasts Charts that can be viewed only using the mobile app. This is because iTunes podcasts charts are limited to genres and not regions. I also did not include those podcasts channels that mainly focus on curating playlists of songs per week. So, this only includes what we can call 'Talk Shows'.
